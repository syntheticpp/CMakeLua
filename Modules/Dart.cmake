# - Configure a project for testing with CTest or old Dart Tcl Client
# This file is the backwards-compatibility version of the CTest module.
# It supports using the old Dart 1 Tcl client for driving dashboard
# submissions as well as testing with CTest.  This module should be included
# in the CMakeLists.txt file at the top of a project.  Typical usage:
#  INCLUDE(Dart)
#  IF(BUILD_TESTING)
#    # ... testing related CMake code ...
#  ENDIF(BUILD_TESTING)
# The BUILD_TESTING option is created by the Dart module to determine
# whether testing support should be enabled.  The default is ON.

# This file configures a project to use the Dart testing/dashboard process.
# It is broken into 3 sections.
#
#  Section #1: Locate programs on the client and determine site and build name
#  Section #2: Configure or copy Tcl scripts from the source tree to build tree
#  Section #3: Custom targets for performing dashboard builds.
#
#
OPTION(BUILD_TESTING "Build the testing tree." ON)

  FIND_PACKAGE(Dart QUIET)

  #
  # Section #1:
  #
  # CMake commands that will not vary from project to project. Locates programs
  # on the client and configure site name and build name.
